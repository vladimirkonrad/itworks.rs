# One-page site — Old-book look with cursor trail

Files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling (old-book / parchment look)
- `script.js` — cursor trail effect when hovering the text

How to open locally:

1. Open Terminal in this folder (`/Users/k/Development/itworks.rs`).

2. Run:

```bash
open index.html
```

or open `index.html` in any browser.

Notes:

- The font uses Google Fonts (`EB Garamond` and `Libre Baskerville`) for a classic book feel.
- The cursor trail appears only while hovering over the text block, leaving subtle fading marks inspired by the effect on `itworks.rs`.
- If you want a stronger or different trail style, tell me which direction (more particles, different colors, longer fade) and I can tweak `script.js` and `styles.css`.
